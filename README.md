# Precision Agriculture using IoT with Java

This project demonstrates a simple precision agriculture system using IoT sensors and Java. It simulates collecting environmental data (such as temperature, soil moisture, and humidity) from various sensors, and sending it to a server for further analysis or decision-making.

## Introduction

Precision agriculture is a farming management concept that uses IoT (Internet of Things) technologies to monitor and optimize agricultural processes such as irrigation, soil moisture, and crop health. This project is a Java-based implementation that demonstrates how to simulate sensor data and send it to a server for further processing.

## Technologies

- **Java**: The primary programming language used.
- **IoT Sensors**: Simulated sensors (temperature, soil moisture, and humidity).
- **Data Transmission**: Data is simulated as being sent to a server (expandable to HTTP/MQTT).

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   https://github.com/jeevanandham-tech/Precision_Agri_IOT
   ```

2. **Install Java**

   Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed. You can download the latest JDK from [Oracle's official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

   To check if Java is installed, run:

   ```bash
   java -version
   ```

   If not installed, download and install the latest version.

3. **IDE Setup**

   You can use any Java IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VSCode for Java. Import the project into your IDE.

## How to Run

1. **Compile the code**: If using the command line, navigate to the `src/main/java` directory and run:

   ```bash
   javac PrecisionAgriculture.java
   ```

2. **Run the Application**:

   ```bash
   java PrecisionAgriculture
   ```

   You should see simulated sensor data being "sent" to the server as output in the terminal.

## Future Enhancements

- **Actual IoT Integration**: Replace simulated data with actual IoT sensor readings (e.g., using Arduino, Raspberry Pi).
- **Database Integration**: Store sensor data in a database (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB) for historical tracking.
- **Cloud Connectivity**: Use platforms like AWS IoT, Google Cloud IoT for handling real-time sensor data at scale.
- **Visualization Dashboard**: Create a web-based or mobile app to visualize real-time and historical sensor data.
